# PIVOTGRAM-92
**A Geometric Framework for Semantic Auditability**

## What PIVOTGRAM-92 Is

PIVOTGRAM-92 is a semantic audit framework that makes **meaning measurable**.

It does not interpret language.  
It does not judge truth.  
It does not enforce policy.

Instead, it provides a way to **detect, measure, and record how meaning moves** as language is transformed—across summarization, translation, policy enforcement, automation, and institutional use.

Where traditional systems rely on interpretation, authority, or precedent,  
PIVOTGRAM relies on **geometry**.

Meaning is treated as a position in a bounded coordinate space.  
Semantic change becomes measurable displacement.

This enables auditability **without requiring agreement on values, culture, or consciousness**.

## The Core Idea

> **If meaning can move, it can be measured.  
> If it can be measured, it can be audited.**

PIVOTGRAM-92 represents semantic intent as a coordinate in a four-dimensional manifold:

- **Temporal** — when meaning applies
- **Orientation** — how intent is directed
- **Scope** — how broadly meaning applies
- **Duty** — whether normative force is claimed

Each semantic act—statement, transformation, policy, or decision—maps to a position in this space.

The distance between two positions is **semantic drift (∇I)**.

Drift is not error.  
Drift is not judgment.  
Drift is a **signal**.

---

## What Problems This Solves

### 1. Semantic Drift Without Detection
Language changes meaning subtly over time—especially in high-stakes contexts.
Temporary permissions become permanent.
Descriptions become obligations.
Local rules become global enforcement.

PIVOTGRAM makes this drift **visible and measurable**.

### 2. Audit Without Surveillance
Most verification systems attempt to preserve or reconstruct original text.
PIVOTGRAM is intentionally **non-invertible**.

You can prove that meaning changed  
without reconstructing what was said.

### 3. Cross-Lingual and Cross-Substrate Verification
Identical intent expressed in different languages—or by humans and machines—maps to the same semantic coordinate.

Auditability becomes **language-independent**.

## What PIVOTGRAM-92 Is Not

PIVOTGRAM-92 is explicitly **not**:

- A language
- A belief system
- A moral authority
- A consciousness detector
- A policy engine
- A replacement for law or human judgment

It does **not** decide what meaning *should* be.  
It only measures **whether meaning has moved, and by how much**.

This constraint is foundational.

---

## The Architecture (At a Glance)

PIVOTGRAM-92 operates as the **audit layer** within a larger semantic stack:

```

VSE defines meaning.
PICTOGRAM expresses meaning.
PIVOTGRAM audits meaning.

```

- **VSE (Vector-Space Esperanto)** provides the semantic physics
- **PICTOGRAM-256** provides human-readable expression
- **PIVOTGRAM-92** provides canonical, sparse audit coordinates

All compilation between expression and audit is mediated by VSE.  
There are no shortcuts.

This prevents semantic laundering and preserves integrity.

---

## The 92 Glyphs

PIVOTGRAM-92 defines a finite, canonical vocabulary of **92 audit glyphs**.

These glyphs are not words.
They are **semantic anchors**.

They cover:
- Temporal primitives
- Orientation markers
- Scope delimiters
- Duty and constraint signals
- Transformation operators
- Governance lifecycle states (ORIGIN, CHECKPOINT, COMMIT, ARCHIVE)

Each glyph has:
- A fixed semantic definition
- A defined coordinate influence
- A non-invertible representation

The set is intentionally finite to preserve long-term stability.

---

## Semantic Drift (∇I)

Semantic drift (∇I) is the geometric distance between two semantic coordinates.

It answers a single question:

> **How far did meaning move?**

Drift:
- Can be small (acceptable)
- Can be large (requires review)
- Is always contextual

PIVOTGRAM does not decide whether drift is permissible.  
It provides the measurement that allows **humans and institutions to decide responsibly**.

---

## Why This Matters Now

PIVOTGRAM-92 exists because modern systems increasingly act on language:

- Laws enforced by software
- Policies summarized by AI
- Rights articulated across cultures
- Decisions made without clear semantic lineage

Without auditability, meaning becomes a hidden failure mode.

With PIVOTGRAM, meaning becomes an **engineering surface**, not a philosophical dispute.

## The Companion Papers

PIVOTGRAM-92 is part of a three-paper framework. Each paper stands alone.

### **PIVOTGRAM-92: A Conceptual Framework for Semantic Auditability**
*This repository*

The technical foundation.  
Four-axis manifold, drift measurement, PSH-256 binding, formal definitions.

### **Rights for Digital and Physical Beings**
A constitutional application of PIVOTGRAM-92.  
Rights encoded as geometric invariants.  
Substrate-neutral enforcement without metaphysical claims.

### **The Infinity Threshold**
The ethical foundation.  
Why irreversibility under uncertainty demands audit-first, conservative design across literacy, AI, hybrid identity, and contact scenarios.

## Final Note

PIVOTGRAM-92 does not tell you what to believe.

It tells you **whether what you believed survived the journey**.

That distinction is the point.
