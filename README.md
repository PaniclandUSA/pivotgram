# pivotgram
PIVOTGRAM is a geometric semantic coordinate system for meaning. It maps intent, context, and narrative purpose in multi-dimensional space, enabling dynamic path-switching and context-aware interpretation without collapsing meaning into fixed labels. This 4D semantic geometry is built on PICTOGRAM-256.
